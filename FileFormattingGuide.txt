File Format conventions:

RETURNED FROM CONTROLLER - A JSON file formatted thusly:
{
  "fields : []
  "total": #total number of records returned
  "results": []
  "moreData": #bool indicating something, not entirely sure what
  "schema": #not sure what the options are but always comes abck biz_txn_v1
}

The list in "fields" contains JSON objects representing fields thusly:
{
  "label": #fieldname
  "field": #identical to above
  "type" : #type of field, stored as a string
  OPTIONAL
  "fields": [] #if type is array, subfields are stored as a list here with the same format, minus a label 
}

The list in fields contains JSON lists, each representing a data point. One such point is a list, with its contents reprenting values. These can be strings, bools, ints, floats, or lists of nested data

The sanitizer expects a JSON file formatted as described above
RETURNED FROM SANITIZER
A Sanitized object that can return the sanitized data as a numpy array, pandas dataframe, or JSON file.
JSON is formatted according to the default spec here (default is 'columns'),  can be altered if necessary:
