File Format conventions:

RETURNED FROM CONTROLLER - A JSON file formatted thusly:
{
  "fields : []
  "total": #total number of records returned
  "results": []
  "moreData": #bool indicating something, not entirely sure what
  "schema": #not sure what the options are but always comes abck biz_txn_v1
}

The list in "fields" contains JSON objects representing fields thusly:
{
  "label": #fieldname
  "field": #identical to above
  "type" : #type of field, stored as a string
  OPTIONAL
  "fields": [] #if type is array, subfields are stored as a list here with the same format, minus a label 
}

The list in fields contains JSON lists, each representing a data point. One such point is a list, with its contents reprenting values. These can be strings, bools, ints, floats, or lists of nested data

The sanitizer expects a JSON file formatted as described above

RETURNED FROM SANITIZER
All categorical data will encoding via one-hot encoding

A Sanitized object that can return the sanitized data as a numpy array, pandas dataframe, or JSON file.
JSON is formatted according to the default spec here (default is 'columns'),  can be altered if necessary:

Andres' Thing (Sorry, not sure of exactly what it does):

Machine Learning:
The RandomForest class will be initialized with Pandas Data Frame as it's only argument. The last column should contain the anomalous behavior data labeled in the following manner:
0 = normal
1 = slow
2 = ver slow
3 = error

Last three columns should be responseTime, eventTimestamp, and anomalous


It will build class attributes that include both a nested python dictionary and a nested json dictionary containing all of the information to create the metrics and visuals for the website. The both the python and json dictionaries are of the same form and have the same keys and values. The following documentation provides the form of the dictionaires and describe the key:value pairs:
