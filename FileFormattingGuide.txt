File Format conventions:

RETURNED FROM CONTROLLER - A JSON file formatted thusly:
{
  "fields : []
  "total": #total number of records returned
  "results": []
  "moreData": #bool indicating something, not entirely sure what
  "schema": #not sure what the options are but always comes abck biz_txn_v1
}

The list in "fields" contains JSON objects representing fields thusly:
{
  "label": #fieldname
  "field": #identical to above
  "type" : #type of field, stored as a string
  OPTIONAL
  "fields": [] #if type is array, subfields are stored as a list here with the same format, minus a label 
}

The list in fields contains JSON lists, each representing a data point. One such point is a list, with its contents reprenting values. These can be strings, bools, ints, floats, or lists of nested data

The sanitizer expects a JSON file formatted as described above
RETURNED FROM SANITIZER
A Sanitized object that can return the sanitized data as a numpy array, pandas dataframe, or JSON file.
JSON is formatted according to the default spec here (default is 'columns'),  can be altered if necessary:

Andres' Thing (Sorry, not sure of exactly what it does):

Machine Learning:
The RandomForest class will be initialized with Pandas Data Frame as it's only argument. The last column should contain the anomalous behavior data labeled in the following manner:
0 = normal
1 = slow
2 = ver slow
3 = error

It will return a JSON object containing anomolous clusters, the features contributing to the groups, the thresholds for the features, and the completeness and purity scores for the corresponding feature + threshold combinations. Viewing it as an array of arrays in Python would resemble the following example:
OuterArray = [cluster1, cluster2, ...]
cluster1 = [[features1, features2, ...], [thresholds1, thresholds2, ...], [(purity1, completeness1),(purity1, completeness1), ...]] # Note: Each cluster will have three sub arrays - one containing the sets of features, one containing the sets of threholds, and one containing the purity and completeness tuples. Each of the three sub arrays will be the same length. A cluster may have have more than one possible set of causing features due to correlation uncertainty. 
features1 = [feature1, feature2, ...] # features1 contains the actual column names
thresholds1 = [(low, high), (low, high), ...] # thresholds1 contains a range tuple for every feature in features1
